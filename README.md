# Overview

We made this program to learn about PyGame and practice working together on a program as a group.

This game is meant to be played like the gameshow: "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?". There are 13 grade levels to choose from with questions
that vary in difficulty based on the selected level. If you successfully answer 14 questions in a row, you win!
